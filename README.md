This training series will help you get started with generating readable and editable standalone C/C++ code from MATLAB® and Simulink®. It will walk you through the workflow and teach you how to navigate and optimize generated code. You will also learn how to use Simulink as an integration environment for different processes and code generation for multi-rate processes before deploying the models directly onto target hardware boards using hardware support packages.
